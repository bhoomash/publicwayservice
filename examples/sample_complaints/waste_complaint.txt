Subject: Garbage Collection Issues in Residential Area

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to report ongoing issues with garbage collection in the Oak Park residential area. For the past three weeks, garbage trucks have been missing our scheduled pickup days, resulting in overflowing bins and unsanitary conditions.

The missed collections have led to:
- Foul odors throughout the neighborhood
- Attraction of rats and other pests
- Scattered garbage due to animals
- Health concerns for residents, especially children and elderly

Our scheduled pickup day is every Tuesday, but collections have been missed on March 5th, March 12th, and March 19th. When I called the sanitation department, I was told there were "route adjustments" but no clear timeline for resolution.

This is affecting the entire Oak Park area (approximately 150 households). Several neighbors have complained, and we're concerned about potential health violations.

Please arrange for immediate pickup of accumulated waste and ensure regular service resumes. We also request compensation or credit for the missed services.

Best regards,
