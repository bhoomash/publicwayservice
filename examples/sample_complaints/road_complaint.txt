Subject: Urgent Road Repair Needed - Main Street Potholes

Dear Municipal Authority,

I am writing to report a serious road condition issue on Main Street between 5th Avenue and 7th Avenue. There are multiple large potholes that have developed over the past month, and they are causing significant problems for both vehicles and pedestrians.

The potholes are approximately 2-3 feet in diameter and 6-8 inches deep. Several vehicles have already suffered tire damage, and I witnessed a motorcycle accident yesterday where the rider lost control after hitting one of these potholes.

The situation is particularly dangerous during evening hours when visibility is poor. Many drivers are swerving into oncoming traffic to avoid the potholes, creating a serious safety hazard.

I urge immediate action to repair these road defects before someone gets seriously injured. This is a high-traffic area with schools and businesses nearby, making it a priority for public safety.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
John Smith
Resident of Main Street
